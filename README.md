microservice-example
====================
This is just a quick example project for taking 4 micro-services (done in DropWizard), then having an
aggregation service (also in DropWizard) which fetches results from the 4 microservices in parallel,
as an alternative to 4 simultaneous AJAX requests from the frontend.
